# Connect4

In this repository we implement Connect Four board game in React.ts following design patterns. 
One part of them are standard, such as _Builder_ and _Singleton_, but there are modern React patterns as well, such as _Conditional Rendering_ and _Presentational Components_ (if you want to know more, please follow this [link](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/react-design-patterns/)).
The app was developed as a project for a Design Patterns course at Graz University of Technology.
